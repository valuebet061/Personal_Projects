Just some projects I worked on as I learn

Alien Game = simple alien invasion game (big help with internalizing object orientated programming)

Algo_strats = a few scripts getting used to pandas, numpy + python data analysis. I have a few simple quant value strats + a momentum strat. Looking to add linear regression + mean reversion soon.
NOTE: I PERSONALLY DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE VALIDITY OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS, the examples here are just used for learning + practical examples. Fundamental is a different story, but looking to build upon those.
