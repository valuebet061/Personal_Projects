Just some projects I worked on as I learn

Alien Game = simple alien invasion game (big help with internalizing object orientated programming)

Algo_basics = a few scripts getting used to pandas, numpy + python data analysis. I have a few simple quant value strats + a momentum strat. Looking to add linear regression + mean reversion soon.
